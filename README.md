To launch the program you need to have/install: 

    - Python 3
    - selenium (pip install selenium)
    - chromedriver (https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/)
    - Google Chrome

Enter your own login, password of your facebook account and the path to chromedriver.exe in config.py:

          SITE_USERNAME = '[enter your email]'
          SITE_PASSWORD = '[enter your password]'
          CHROME_DRIVER = ('C:\\[enter the path to chromedriver]\\chromedriver.exe')
    
Run the program and enjoy the process ;)
